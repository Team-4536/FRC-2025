confirm that we can actually reset the gyro with a new angle

Remove excess *.yaw set line in HAL
Fix SwerveDrive.resetOdometry() such that it overwrites the gyro yaw with the pose yaw
Replace all self.odometry.resetPosition() with SwerveDrive.resetOdometry()
Skim for other yaw / resetPosition statements and align them with above.


Good practices:
  Stick to one "domain" for units CCW +pi to -pi radians - Only the HAL_hardware should have any other units (e.g., when interfacing with NavX)
