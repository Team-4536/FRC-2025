Do all of the following setps in the terminal
Make sure the the directory you are working in is FRC-2025

run: 'py -m venv .venv'

venv is the package that makes virtual enviroments and .venv is the name of the new virtual enviroment folder

now activate the virtual enviroment

run: '.\.venv\Scripts\activate'

you should now see "(.venv)" on the left of the terminal

now install required packages

while you run the second command you will be prompted to upgrade the pyproject.toml file DON'T

run: 'py -m pip install robotpy'
run: 'py -m robotpy --main src sync'

to make sure that the virtual enviroment is active run the activate script from before

another way to check is to run 'where.exe python'
if the first result is 'C:\repos\FRC-2025\.venv\Scripts\python.exe' then it is activated
